# External Links

Literally every section in the guide would be worth containing an external link for as we only brush the surface of every topic we use; everything from scopes to routing, ng-repeat, directives and services, are all big topics which deserve their own guides.

## Required Content

- Section 10, Promises and $http

We refer to the usual JavaScript Promises API and talk about the similarities of the $http service in angular but never talk about how promises actually work. Would be nice to find something talking about the $q service in detail.


- Section 13, the Complete Inbox Directive

Here we need something to go into detail about lots of other directives such as ng-show,hide,model,bind,click,etc...

The next section (14) does talk about ng-repeat a little bit as well as touching on ng-model, but neither in great detail.
