## Client-side MVC

Let's start with a concept that's core to Angular: client-side MVC. MVC stands for Model, View, Controller. Let's explore each concept individually:

* Model: That's the data; the business information of the application.
* View: The HTML and presentation of the data. That's what the user sees and interacts with.
* Controller: The connector that makes all the different pieces of our application work together.

The MVC pattern is a proven approach to organizing application code that's been refined over many years.

__Fun fact:__ Ruby on Rails is an MVC framework for the Ruby programming language.

Angular likes to use MC* techniques, where the * stands for 'whatever' (often refered to as [MVW](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13329485/mvw-what-does-it-stand-for)). In other words, the Controller part is different to usual, but this is beside the point, lets get something working.
